**Export LilyPond scores to MusicXML**

---

This repository was created as a stub for the possible development of a LilyPond-to-MusicXML converter/export.

As there is urgent need for such a thing but no actual development, 
this repository should serve as a start to collect ideas/aspects
and eventually even _code_.

However, actual development with regard to XML conversion of and to LilyPond scores
is done in the context of the [Frescobaldi](https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi) project
and its [python-ly](https://github.com/wbsoft/python-ly) Python module.
